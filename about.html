					This Portland based website is a post-disaster preparation site created to provide you with the information you need to keep you and your loved ones safe. There are some tier one facilities and BEECN's that are locations recognized by the Portland Bureau of Emergency Management for having great importance in a post-disaster situation. This site will provide you with important "tips & tricks" for various types of natural disasters and also gives the user the ability to generate a route to your nearest disaster facility. You will also find a list of phone numbers to contact for any other questions or concerns. Not only does this help the population of Portland to better prepare for disaster events but also gives the city officials to have better control and knowledge over the situations.
